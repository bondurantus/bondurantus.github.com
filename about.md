## Hello!

I am a San Francisco-based letterer and illustrator. I believe in the power of tactile craftsmanship. You can view samples of my work [here](http://lorenbondurant.tumblr.com/tagged/commission).

I accept commissions for projects ranging from wedding certificates, signage and book plate designs.  If you are interested in discussing a project, please contact [me](/contact).

Thanks for visiting!
